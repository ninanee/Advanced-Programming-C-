-The program models a menu of options that is used in text-based interactive programs.

-The user is first presented with a list of options to choose from and is then prompted to enter a value corresponding to an option.

-The purpose of the program is to implement the following in C++:

1. delegate runtime storage management to the Standard Template Library (STL) containers: vector, list, forward_list

2. gain experience using the STL sequential containers

3. use iterators to access and manipulate container elements

4. practice text input / output file processings
