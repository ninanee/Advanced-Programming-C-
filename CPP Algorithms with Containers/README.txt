The 1-5 task is in the Dog.cpp file, and the task 6-9 is in the test_driver_6789.cpp file

The 1-5 task of the project is based on the CSV files that contain information about different dogs. 

The task 6-9 of the project provides various functions that can be created using the C++ algorithms.

The following functions are implemented for the files having information about dogs:
1) loading information about dogs from an input file into a dog multimap
2) outputting information about all the dogs having the specified breed

The following functions are implemented just for any corresponding input:
1) trimming whitespaces before or after a word
2) testing if a phrase is a palindrome
3) finding the second largest element in a container
4) counting strings of the supplied length in a vector
5) sorting strings according to their lexicographical order


The following algorithms are used:
1) for_each
2) transform
3) equal_range
4) equal
5) copy_if
6) count_if
7) remove_copy_if
